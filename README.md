# Data-Visualization---Rolling-Dice-with-Ploty
I'll use Python package Ploty, to produce interactive visualizations, then i'll analyze the results of rolling dice. When we roll one regular, six-sided die, we have an equal chace of rolling any of the numbers from 1 through 6. However, when we use two dice, we're more likely to roll certain numbers rather than others.
