# Data-Visualization---Rolling-Dice-with-Plotly
I'll use Python package Plotly, to produce interactive visualizations, then i'll analyze the results of rolling dice. When we roll one regular, six-sided die, we have an equal chace of rolling any of the numbers from 1 through 6. However, when we use two dice, we're more likely to roll certain numbers rather than others. I'll try to determine which numbers are most likely to occur by generating a data set that represents rolling dice. Then i'll plot the results of a large number of rolls to determine which results are more likely than others.
